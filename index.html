            HTTP/1.1 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol 1.1) and HTTP/2 are both
            protocols used for communication on the World Wide Web. While they
            share the same basic purpose of enabling communication between
            clients and servers, there are several key differences between the
            two:
            <br />
            Multiplexing: HTTP/1.1: In HTTP/1.1, each request and response is
            processed sequentially, and only one request/response is allowed to
            be in progress at a time on a connection. HTTP/2: HTTP/2 introduces
            multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be
            processed in parallel over a single connection. This can
            significantly improve page load times and overall performance.
            <br />
            Header Compression: HTTP/1.1: Headers are not compressed, and
            redundant header information is often resent with each request and
            response. HTTP/2: Headers are compressed using a new, more efficient
            algorithm (HPACK), reducing overhead and improving performance,
            especially for websites with a large number of small resources.
            Binary Protocol: HTTP/1.1: It uses a text-based protocol, which is
            human-readable but can be inefficient in terms of parsing and
            processing. HTTP/2: It uses a binary protocol, which is more
            efficient to parse and process by machines. While it's not
            human-readable, it is more compact and allows for faster data
            transmission. Server Push: HTTP/1.1: The server can only respond to
            client requests. HTTP/2: Introduces server push, allowing the server
            to send additional resources to the client before the client
            explicitly requests them. This can be beneficial for loading
            resources proactively. Connection Handling: HTTP/1.1: Requires
            multiple connections for parallelism, which can lead to increased
            latency and resource usage. HTTP/2: Allows multiple streams within a
            single connection, reducing the need for multiple connections and
            improving efficiency. Prioritization: HTTP/1.1: No built-in
            mechanism for prioritizing requests. HTTP/2: Supports request
            prioritization, allowing more important resources to be requested
            and delivered first, improving overall page load performance. In
            summary, HTTP/2 is designed to address the limitations and
            performance bottlenecks of HTTP/1.1, offering improvements in terms
            of speed, efficiency, and support for modern web applications. The
            adoption of HTTP/2 has become more widespread, and it is
            increasingly becoming the standard for web communication.

            In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data type and a key aspect
            of the language's flexibility. Objects are used to represent and
            store data in the form of key-value pairs. The internal
            representation of objects in JavaScript is based on a few key
            concepts: Properties: Objects in JavaScript have properties, which
            are essentially key-value pairs. The key is a string or symbol, and
            the value can be of any data type, including other objects.
            Properties can be accessed using dot notation (object.property) or
            square bracket notation (object['property']). Methods: In addition
            to properties, objects can also have methods. Methods are functions
            associated with an object and are defined as properties whose values
            are functions. Prototype Chain: Each object in JavaScript is linked
            to a prototype object from which it inherits properties and methods.
            This forms a chain of objects known as the prototype chain. If a
            property or method is not found on an object, JavaScript looks up
            the prototype chain until it finds the property or until it reaches
            the end of the chain. Constructor: Objects can be created using
            constructor functions or literal notation. Constructor functions are
            used to create and initialize objects with specific properties and
            methods. Constructor functions often use the this keyword to refer
            to the object being created. Object Literal Notation: Objects can be
            created using literal notation by enclosing key-value pairs in curly
            braces {}.

            In JavaScript, both the document and window objects are fundamental
            components of the browser's Document Object Model (DOM), but they
            represent different aspects of the environment. Here are the main
            differences between the document and window objects: Scope:
            document: The document object represents the HTML document itself.
            It provides methods and properties to interact with the content
            within the HTML document, such as elements, attributes, and styles.
            window: The window object represents the browser window or tab. It
            is the global object in the browser environment and contains
            properties and methods related to the browser window, such as
            navigation, location, history, and the global scope for JavaScript.
            Hierarchy: document: The document object is a property of the window
            object. You can access it using window.document or simply document.
            window: The window object is the top-level object in the browser's
            JavaScript environment. All global variables and functions are
            properties of the window object. Responsibilities: document: Manages
            the structure and content of the HTML document. It provides methods
            for selecting, manipulating, and creating elements within the
            document. window: Manages the browser window and its features. It
            includes methods for controlling navigation, handling events, and
            accessing information about the browser environment. Lifetime:
            document: The document object is created when the HTML document is
            parsed and loaded. It represents the current state of the document.
            window: The window object is created when the browser window is
            opened and persists throughout the lifetime of the page. It
            represents the entire browser window and provides a global context
            for JavaScript. Global Scope: document: The document object is not
            part of the global scope by default. It is a property of the window
            object. window: The window object is always in the global scope, and
            global variables and functions are properties of the window object.
            In summary, while the document object deals specifically with the
            content and structure of the HTML document, the window object
            represents the broader browser environment and provides methods and
            properties related to the entire browser window.
